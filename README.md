📈 Business Data Dashboard

📚 Project Overview:
Welcome to my project, where I developed a Business Data Dashboard to analyze and visualize 1M+ customer transactions for targeted marketing. I implemented data preprocessing, EDA, SQL database storage, and a FastAPI + Streamlit WebUI for statistical insights. This tool enables easy data filtering and reduces manual effort from ~2 hours to ~10 minutes.

📊 Data Preprocessing: Cleans raw data and creates meaningful business features.

🏢 SQL Database Integration: Efficient storage and fast data retrieval.

💻 Interactive Web UI: Built with FastAPI and Streamlit for intuitive data visualization and easy access to filtered feature data.
